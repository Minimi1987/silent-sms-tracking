üì° Silent SMS Tracking Implementation in Python

üö® Attention
This project provides a Python implementation for silent SMS tracking. This code is for educational purposes only. Using this technique to track devices without consent is illegal and unethical.

üìñ Overview
This repository demonstrates a basic implementation for sending silent SMS, collecting response data, and using that data to estimate the location of a device. While it is a simplified implementation, it covers the core concepts needed for silent SMS tracking.

üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup
bash
Copy code
pip install pygsm smpplib geopy
üöÄ Features

1. Silent SMS Sending
   Send silent SMS messages to a target phone number, without the recipient device displaying any notification.

python
Copy code
import smpplib
import smpplib.gsm

def send_silent_sms(target_number, message=""): # Code to send silent SMS
pass

send_silent_sms("+1234567890") 2. SMS Data Reception and Processing
Receive and process SMS response data using a GSM modem, essential for triangulation calculations.

python
Copy code
import pygsm

def process_received_sms(modem): # Code to process received SMS
pass

modem = pygsm.GsmModem(port="/dev/ttyUSB0", baudrate=115200)
modem.connect()
process_received_sms(modem) 3. Basic Triangulation
Implement basic triangulation using three cell towers to estimate the location of a device.

python
Copy code
from geopy import distance

def triangulate(tower1, tower2, tower3, dist1, dist2, dist3): # Code for basic triangulation
pass 4. Full Integration
Integrate all functionalities into a main loop for continuous real-time tracking.

python
Copy code
import threading
import time

def main(): # Code for the main loop
pass

if **name** == "**main**":
main()
üéØ Example Usage
Replace "+1234567890" with the target phone number and run the script:

bash
Copy code
python silent_sms_tracking.py
‚ö†Ô∏è Note
This implementation is a simplified version for educational purposes. In a real scenario, significant improvements would be required, such as error handling, secure communication protocols, and integration with real cellular network infrastructures.
